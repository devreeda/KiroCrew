"""The keyed-value fixture is the one oracle every copy of the value scanner answers to.

``test/redaction_keyed_value_fixture.py`` generates it from the canonical redactor;
this file pins (1) that the committed JSON equals a fresh generation, so the file
cannot drift from the code, (2) that every row holds on the redactor, on the stream
at six chunk sizes, on the hard URL floor and on the packaging scan's vendored
scanner, and (3) that the scanner is linear in its input by construction. The
chat mirror reads the same file in
``website/src/test/sanitizeCredentials.fixture.test.ts``.
