/**
 * Closing a session tree — what the close would take down, as a pure function.
 *
 * The session tree's ✕ closes a card and the sessions nested under it. A lead with
 * three workers, each with sub-workers, is one card over seven sessions, and the
 * press is unrecoverable: an in-flight turn is cancelled and its partial work is
 * discarded. So before anything closes, the UI has to be able to say what the press
 * reaches and how much of it is still working (#17253).
 *
 * This module answers exactly that and does nothing else: no React, no store, no
 * I/O, no `deleteSlot`. The dialog copy and the close loop both read the same plan,
 * so the list a user consents to cannot differ from the sessions that are closed.
 *
 * KEY SPACE. Plans are built and returned in RAW slot-key space — the space
 * `deleteSlot` takes — not in the sidebar's origin-qualified row identities. A
 * federated peer row has no local slot to close, so it is not plannable from here
 * and callers pass their local rows.
